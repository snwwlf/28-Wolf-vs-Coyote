            <h2>How to Play</h2>

            <p>To begin gameplay, set the Evasive Number by clicking the respective button that picks 
                a number between 1 and 6. This represents the number the Coyote player will use to protect
                itself from receiving damage. For example, the evasive number is set to 3, meaning whenever 
                the coyote rolls a 3, regardless of what the Wolf rolls, they will never lose points. This is
                known as evading an attack.</p>

            <p>Each player, the Wolf and Coyote, start the game with 20 health points, which are displayed under
                their respective images. Throughout the game, players will lose points until a player reaches 0. 
                Whichever player with points remaining wins the game.</p>
            
            <p>Once the evasive button is set, gameplay will begin by clicking the Roll Dice button. This will display
                updated score, what number each player rolled, and a corresponding message below as to what occurred
                during that round of gameplay.
            </p>

            <h2>Round Outcomes</h2>

            <h3>Wolf Critical Hit</h3>

            <p>When the Wolf player rolls a 6, they deal a critical hit upon the Coyote player where they lose 
                2 points instead of 1.</p>

            <h3>Evasive Roll</h3>

            <p>If the Coyote player rolls a number that matches their set Evasive number, for example, a 4, whenever
                they roll a 4, neither player loses points as Coyote has evaded an attack by the Wolf. </p>
            
            <h3>Coyote High-Score Evasive</h3>

            <p>If the Evasive number is set to 6, whenever the coyote player rolls a 6, the wolf player loses 1 point.</p>

            <h3>Standard Win</h3>

            <p>The Wolf and Coyote players each roll a die with numbers 1 through 6. Whoever rolls the higher number, with 6
                being the highest one can roll, they will win that round of gameplay. The winning player will keep their 
                current score while the losing player subtracts one point.</p>

            <h3>Tie</h3>

            <p>Should each player roll their respective die and have the same number, neither player loses points.</p>

            <h2>Winning The Game</h2>

            <p>Whichever player has points remaining after numerous rounds of gameplay, having not reached zero,
                is declared the winner. There is a respective banner displayed declaring the winner outright.</p>

            <h2>Game Reset</h2>

            <p>When the game ends once a player is declared the winner, or if the players wish to restart, they can 
                click the Reset button to start a new game.</p>
